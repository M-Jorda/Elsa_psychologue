## Description
This project involves the creation of a website for Destenabes Elsa, a clinical psychologist and psychotherapist. The website is designed to present her psychotherapy services, facilitate online appointment scheduling, and provide practical information about her consultations.

## Problem
Patients often face difficulties in finding a psychologist who suits their needs or in easily scheduling appointments online. The identified challenges are:
- No centralized platform for online appointment scheduling.
- Lack of detailed information about the services offered and therapeutic methods.
- Difficulty in directly contacting the therapist for information or quick contact.

A successful solution would allow patients to schedule appointments directly online, learn about the offered services, and access relevant information about therapy.

## Objective
Create a web platform that allows Elsa Destenabes to present her psychotherapy services, provide a simple way to contact her and manage consultations, and communicate with her patients securely.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML/CSS**: Structure and styling of the website.
- **JavaScript**: Dynamism and interactivity.
- **MySQL**: Database management for consultations and contacts.
- **Bootstrap**: Responsive layout and modern design.
- **Figma**: Interface design and prototyping.
- **GitHub**: Version control and collaboration.
- **VSCode**: Integrated development environment.
